/// The physics every 1978 game shares; the three subclasses are the three
/// game variants on the cabinet's game-select knob. Compare with
/// ClassicPlayingState — the sequel kept the materializing serve, the
/// discrete speed ladder and the four-exit paddle, and changed three laws:
///
///  - The pass-through rule replaces "one brick per trip". A ball the paddle
///    has not returned yet sails through bricks untouched, and after every
///    destroyed brick the ball *bores*: it keeps sailing through for four
///    rows, or until it touches the paddle or the top boundary. 1976's
///    dis-armed ball rebounded and spared the brick; 1978's spares the brick
///    and does not even rebound.
///  - The half-width penalty moved: it now triggers on top-boundary contact
///    and heals at the next serve.
///  - Scores multiply by the number of balls in play — the sequel exists to
///    put more than one ball on screen — and only the *served* ball costs a
///    serve when lost. Bonus balls (Double's second serve, Cavity's freed
///    captives) are free.
